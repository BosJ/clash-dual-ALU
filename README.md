ClaSH-dual-ALU
==============

A simplified but working and synthesizable example of a dual-ALU processor in less than 100 lines of code to get an idea of how a processor can be described with CλaSH. The method of identifying sub-blocks in a conceptual schematic with direct relations to corresponding CλaSH functions and connecting these functions at a top level is used.
